#Note - This script will look for all AD groups and pull the relevent details.  Note, it will pull all groups, both Sec and Distro.
#This section of the script could be used anytime a complete list of groups from a domain is needed.  In my case, I used the output from this as an input to count users in each group.

#Load the PS Module
Import-Module ActiveDirectory

#The Get-ADGroup is the tool used.  I found in large environments the DC your PC is using may not be idea.  I recommend finding a server that is nearby, fast, and not heavily loaded that contains a replica of the domain.
Get-ADGroup -Properties * -Filter * -Server DC-NAME-OR-IP-HERE | 

#The Select statement is the data we will pull from the domain for future use.  You may want to pull other data, but this works for what I needed.
